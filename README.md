<h1>SentenceAnalyzer</h1>
  <strong><h2>One of my very first machine learning (neural network) projects with limited examples but still capable to predict the following parameters:</h2></strong>
  <ol>
    <li><h3><i>Sentence Type</h3></i></li>
    <li><h3><i>Tense</h3></i></li>
    <li><h3><i>Sentiment</h3></i></li>
    <li><h3><i>Toxicity</h3></i></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Website is built using vanilla javascript and the actual model is being hosted on repl.it with node.js & tensorflow.js however the website is hosted on glitch built, it is accurate for most common & basic sentences however if yougive it an advanced english based sentence it won't be accurate. Specially the first parameter of Sentence Type. It uses dense layer & adam optimizer.</p>

  <p><u>The following is a screenshot of the actual & final website with css & etc:</u></p>

  The model can be improved a lot by training with more & better training data and more layers. I might work on it in future.
